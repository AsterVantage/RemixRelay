RemixRelay
White Paper v0.9 — July 2025
________________


1 Executive Summary
The global creator economy passed $250 billion in 2025 and is still compounding at 20 %+ CAGR. Yet 91 % of creators now say they spend “most of the week” repurposing the same long-form content into shorts, threads, thumbnails and reels. Current AI tools tackle one slice—clipping, captioning or cross-posting—but no one platform automates the entire remix conveyor-belt. RemixRelay fills that gap: upload once, receive platform-native assets, auto-schedule them, and watch performance data feed the next round. (InBeat, Forbes)

2 Market Landscape
Metric
	Proof
	Implication
	Creator-economy value
	$250 B today; on track for $528 B by 2030 (InBeat, Forbes)
	Enormous, still expanding TAM
	Tool adoption
	91 % of creators already use Gen-AI in workflow (InBeat)
	AI tooling is mainstream, but point-solutions dominate
	Competitor evidence
	OpusClip hit 10 M users / $20 M ARR in < 24 mo with only clip-making (signalhub.substack.com, arr.club)
	Shows appetite—and room to up-sell a fuller workflow
	________________


3 Problem Statement
Creators and social-first teams waste up to ⅔ of production hours on:
1. Highlight hunting — scrubbing 30-60 min videos for hook moments.

2. Brand-safe styling — resizing, captioning, colour-correcting.

3. Cross-platform formatting — each network’s aspect ratios, length caps, character limits.

4. Manual posting — juggling five different schedulers.

5. Analytics feedback — exporting CSVs, guessing why a clip popped.

No tool today closes all five gaps in a single loop.

6 Technology & Architecture (high-level)
   * Cursor-first development — pair-programming agents and /todo automation speed feature iteration.

   * Back-end — Node + FastAPI, Supabase (Postgres + pgvector), AWS S3 for raw + rendered media. Spot g5.xlarge GPU (≈$0.42/hr) for vision & diffusion workloads.

   * ML stack —

      * Whisper v3 for ASR (OpenAI)

      * GPT-4o for copy & hook generation ( $2.50 / 1 M input tokens; $10 / 1 M output )

      * Open-source Stable-Diffusion XL for thumbnails (on-GPU)

         * Publishers — OAuth + official APIs for YouTube, X (first), LinkedIn / IG / TikTok (road-map).

         * Security — uploads scanned via AWS Rekognition SafeSearch; SOC-2 alignment planned once ARR > $1 M.

7 Differentiation vs. Existing Tools
| Capability | OpusClip / Vizard | Descript | RemixRelay |
|---|---|---|
| Highlight detection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + self-learning from analytics |
| Brand-kit automation | ❌ | ⚠️ limited templates | ✅ full stylebook |
| Auto cap/crop for every platform | ⚠️ vertical only | ❌ | ✅ vertical + square + 16∶9 |
| Multi-format text (threads, carousels) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Scheduling & cross-posting | ⚠️ simple export | ❌ | ✅ AI time optimizer |
| Feedback-driven retrain | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
—No single rival owns the closed loop (create → publish → learn). (Descript, Deliberate Directions)

10 Risks & Mitigations
Risk
	Mitigation
	Platform API changes / bans
	Abstract posting layer; weekly automated endpoint tests
	GPU / API cost spikes
	Fall-back to open-source local models; dynamic routing
	DMCA & brand-safety liabilities
	Automated SafeSearch + takedown flow; indemnity caps in ToS
	Entrant copycats
	Data network effect (engagement-driven model retrain) + creator brand-kit lock-in

11 Conclusion
RemixRelay attacks the highest-friction slice of the creator workflow with a full-stack, brand-safe conveyor-belt. The TAM is vast, paying behaviour is proven, yet competitors remain siloed. With a lean two-founder team, modern AI APIs, and Cursor-accelerated dev-ops, we can launch a public beta in under four months for < $5 k cash burn—well before incumbents glue their point tools together.
One upload. One dashboard. Infinite remixes.
 That’s the edge creators—and the market—are waiting for.
